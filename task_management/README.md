# Task Management

Starting with Mozilla there was one thing I needed to get good at fast. I knew from experience that just being an active volunteer contributor lead to a lot of emails, let alone being a full time paid contributor.

One thing I knew wouldn't work for me (as it never did for university) was lists. I hate lists. They're easy to make, and even easier to ignore.

Though list based task management might work well for many, it certainly does not for me. “What order do items have to be in? What priority should I give this thing? How granular should a task be?” All questions I could never find an answer too.

Thankfully a few weeks before starting my placement I had a sit down with [Michelle Thorne](http://michellethorne.cc/) who showed me an alternative method which I've since taken to all a whole new level of task management geekdom.

## The Urgency vs Importance Graph
This is a complex looking system that hides amazing simplicity and flexibility.

It relies on a couple of simple tricks to quickly and easily make decision on what to spend time on, and when.

1. You start with a simple graph of Urgency vs Importance (U vs I). **Ensure to leave your axis valueless.**
2. Beneath your graph make an **unordered** list of meta tasks you want to achieve by the end of the timeframe. For me this timeframe is a week.
    * You should give each item a unique reference. I simply number them from top to bottom.
3. Go through each item in the list, and plot it on your graph based on gut feeling of its importance and urgency.
    * You should think about importance as a measure of how critical something is, along with the benefits it will produce.
    * Urgency should be mostly concerned with when something needs to be started, to be done on time.

*For a more in-depth description of how this process works [read the article about this system on MindTools](http://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newHTE_91.htm).*

When you get towards the end of the week you get to colour things in. This is the best and worst bit of the process.

* Tasks which are completed get shaded in <span style="color:green;">**green**</span>.
* Anything that is incomplete becomes <span style="color:darkorange;">**orange**</span>.
* Those few which get abandoned for any reason is highlighted, with a reason, in <span style="color:red;">**red**</span>.
* Ongoing tasks, or multi-week tasks, are given a lovely shade of <span style="color:blue;">**blue**</span>.
